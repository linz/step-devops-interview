# step-devops-interview
Contains the scripts for DevOps Technical Interview

1. We have an application (frontend – ReactJS, backend that exposes api that retrieves data from database – Kotlin) and we are building it as a Docker image. 
  * What kind of cloud architecture would you design for managing container workloads for this application on AWS?
  *	Please prepare a simple cloud architecture diagram to explain your answer and you can draw it on the whiteboard.
2. There is a Jenkinsfile in this repository (https://github.com/linz/step-devops-interview).
  * Could you please tell us, based on the Jenkinsfile, what does the pipeline do?
  * I want to be notified when a stage fails, how can we do it?
